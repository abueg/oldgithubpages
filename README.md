## about
I am a bioinformatician working for the Vertebrate Genome Lab at Rockefeller University, where we aim to generate high-quality reference genomes across for all vertebrate species. We are currently in Phase 1 of our effort, wherein we are sequencing a taxonomically representative species for each vertebrate order.
